# Hip-Hop Text Collage: An Artistic Text-to-Speech Concept

## Core Concept
Creating a text-to-speech system that transforms input text into a hip-hop collage by finding and assembling existing phrases from classic rap tracks. The output is intentionally artificial, celebrating the "chopped and screwed" aesthetic while preserving the context and energy of the original samples.

## Key Principles

### 1. Longer Phrases Over Individual Words
- Prioritize finding complete phrases (2+ seconds) over individual words
- Preserve natural flow, context, and musical elements
- Keep the original emotion and delivery intact
- Example: Using a full "the future is now" rather than assembling individual words

### 2. Quality Over Speed
- Processing time (5+ minutes) is acceptable and meaningful
- Each output is a unique artistic piece
- Focus on finding perfect matches rather than quick assembly
- The search process itself becomes part of the artistic experience

### 3. Embrace the Artifacts
- Don't try to remove music/beats from samples
- Keep reverb, effects, background elements
- Maintain the original track's atmosphere
- Let the choppy transitions be part of the aesthetic

### 4. Less is More
- Fewer, longer samples are better than many short ones
- Each cut should be meaningful and carry context
- Minimum sample length around 0.5 seconds
- Finding fewer matches might indicate more meaningful content

### 5. Musical Context
- Inspired by DJ Screw's chopped and screwed technique
- Slowing down helps identify and understand phrases
- Tempo manipulation as an artistic tool
- Preserves the musical context of samples

## Technical Approach

### Sample Selection
1. First attempt: Find complete target phrase
2. Second attempt: Split into 2-3 meaningful chunks
3. Last resort: Individual words (only if necessary)

### Processing Steps
1. Search through classic hip-hop tracks
2. Identify matching phrases
3. Apply tempo/pitch modifications
4. Assemble final collage

### Sample Requirements
- Minimum length: ~0.5 seconds
- Include musical context
- Clear, recognizable phrases
- Natural breakpoints

## Artistic Intent
- Not aiming for "clean" or "natural" speech
- Creating a new form of musical expression
- Each output is a unique collage of hip-hop history
- Celebrates the source material while creating new meaning

## Use Cases
- Artistic installations
- Music production
- Poetry/spoken word transformation
- Hip-hop education/reference
- Remix culture exploration

## Implementation Notes
- Use existing lyrics databases (e.g., Genius API)
- Focus on finding exact phrase matches
- Consider tempo/pitch manipulation tools
- Preserve metadata about sample sources
- Document the "digging" process

## Success Criteria
- Samples feel meaningful and contextual
- Output maintains musical quality
- Clear connection to source material
- Intentional, artistic result
- Authentic to hip-hop culture and sampling tradition
